## React Trello

![`board`](http://g.recordit.co/jEHkR4C7BJ.gif)
A [Trello](trello.com) clone, written with React. 

Play with it at [https://react-trello.now.sh/](https://react-trello.now.sh/)

### Why

I use this project to play around with some technologies. Namely: 
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
- [AWS Amplify](https://github.com/aws-amplify/amplify-cli) for the backend, GraphQL API and Auth
- [Apollo Hooks](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/api/react-hooks/) as a GraphQL client
- [React Spring](https://www.react-spring.io/) for animations

### Usage

The backend is already set up. Simply install the frontend dependencies and start the development server:

> `yarn && yarn start`
